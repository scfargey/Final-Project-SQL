# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
goals for this project are to get a full understanding of the data set, clean and remove erronious data, and then provide insight from the final form. 

In  addition, finding ways to provide a prospective client with ways to improve on their data collection efforts. 

## Process
### (your step 1)
Spend time getting oritneted with the data and the connections between the tables. Understand primary keys for each table, and foreign related keys in others. 

Build out ERD for visual view of the database
### (your step 2)
clean/transform data into digestible and proper datatypes, remove duplicate values.

### (Step 3)
query the data to find insights into what data proper and available to us at this time


## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)
I faced quite a few challenges in this project as there was very little information provided as to what the data was about and how the tables were related. I spent too much time trying to decipher the connection between the analytics table and the all_sessions table. I knew right away the VisitId was going to be the column, but then and ended up realizing that the visitID was duplicated and there was no other column to properly create a primary key on that table.  

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
If I had more time I would get as the prospective client about the tables and where they came from, because all the data seems incomplete.

I would also try to find out if the all_sessions table was accurate on product_quantity and price and fix the revenue columns as they don't seem to add up.
